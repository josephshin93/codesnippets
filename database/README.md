# Code Snippet / Boba: Database'

### What is it

A temporary RESTful API for Cloud Firestore queries

### Reason for existing

This was done to test the endpoints right away without needing to implement an actual backend. It is done with Express, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Functions. As CRUD functions get fleshed out it will be integrated into our actual server

### Status

Active, Experiment
Currently working on GET functions and next up is POST

### How this was setup

Created our Firebase project and added the data structure in Console. Added Firebase Hosting and Functions on my machine. Initialized and chose TypeScript as our language. Installed package dependencies. Wrote GET functions based on our design mocks. Deployed everything. Tested those functions
