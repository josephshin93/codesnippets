Code Snippets is a web application that assists software development teams communicate their progress. Each member on a team can create posts containing a snippet of code and/or task and Code Snippets will keep these posts organized for your team. You can search and sort all relevant posts. With weekly submissions and updates, everyone in the team can be on the same page as they advance through their project goals.
